<h2>About My passion</h2>

<p>To start with, I'm a very interesting fellow, who's very hard to understand. A selfless attitude towards 
  anyone whom I come across with. I'm of a very friendly nature and love to be with people who aren't selfish.
 Ambitious can do anything to achieve my aim</p>

 <p>I'm of a very competitive nature but love to find good in everything I see. According to me, there are
   many things that make us depressed or upset, but that doesn't mean that we stop living. In fact, problems
   are a sign of life. They make us believe that we are living. The only people who have no problems are in 
  cemeteries. So we shall be fortunate that we have problems. It enhances our minds. This is the philosophy
   of my life.</p>

<p>I'm a lover of nature. Rain, moon, clouds, gardens, greenery is all I'm the most attracted towards. I love
 to be around it. I'm a lover of peace, harmony, and prosperity around me.
 English is my heart. I'm devoted to it. I won't have any existence without it. I have completely surrendered 
 myself to it. Writing poems and reading books is my passion.About my schedule, so I'm a very punctual fellow,
  love to have all the work on time and the way I wish to.</p>
 

<p>There are many people living in the world having different personalities. This is the personality that
 makes everyone unique and different from others. Talking about myself, I'm a rare piece of myself. You can't
 find a person in the same way as that of mine. I am a self-centered fellow, loves to adore the beauty of life
 and achieve my dreams. I have an aim, that's to become a web developer now. And I would do anything to achieve
 my goal.</p>
